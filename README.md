# 👋 Welcome to Colgan Software (A "Dan Colgan" production)

Hi, I’m **Dan Colgan** – the developer behind **Colgan Software Solutions**. With 26+ years as a Senior .NET Applications Developer, I specialize in building robust, scalable systems that bring together the best of modern software engineering practices. I have begin practicing almost exclusively the CLEAN/SOLID design principle(s).  I work primarily with business information data (invoicing, order processing, communications).  I am looking for a position with a solid company that values the experience and understands the wealth of information that I have cannot generally be regurgitated in a single sitting and I do have to look things up now and then to confirm syntax.  If you're looking for someone with an idolic memory; keep looking LOL but if you need a great developer who knows the theory and can put it into practice then I'm your man.
